# Webforms_HW7
In this project I created a social media quiz. In my quiz I utilied input boxes, radio buttones, dropdown boxes, and check boxes. I got familiar with writing HTML code, uploading pictures via code, utilizing field validators and functions like autofocus.

My webform conforms to best practice because I broke the form into seperate pages. In theory I could have put all of my questions on to one page but by breaking the questions up I am more likely to keep whoever is viewing my webforms focused by reducing the cognitive load of seeing a lot of fields at the same time. I made sure to utilize title case when applicable like for First Name and Last Name but sentance case for longer titles due to the fact is is easier to read.

On my webpage I utilized various tools like a progress indicator that displays what page the use is on so they no what to expect. I made sure to use a simple font so everything is easy to read and they can take the forms smoothly. I made sure to constantly label everything to mitigate confusions along with adding field markers like "None' or "Other" incase the end user does not have a social media preference. 

I made sure that before the submission of the form the user is aware. The final button is labeled 'Submit' and once they hit that button they are prompted to a thank you screen. This is so the end user knows that they have approached the end and successful have submitted the quiz so that there is no confusion.

Furthermore, I made sure to have an appealing and not overbearing background color along with a font that contrasts nicely so that everything is aesthetic and looks professional. I also made sure that there were not multiple action buttons on my forms because I did not want to distract whoever was viewing my forms. I made note not to include a reset button as I feel that generally does more harm than good.

This project was one that I had tons of fun making and it taught me a lot when it comes to using HTML and creating webforms.
